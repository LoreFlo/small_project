Small Project
================

This is an example RStudio Project set up to be somewhat reproducible,
showing how data can (and should) be included within the Project
Directory and how R Notebooks can be numbered in the order that they
must be evaluated, with outputs going into numbered subdirectories of
the outputs directory.

The `outputs` directory is not under version control, as its path is
included in the `.gitignore` file.

Running those files requires the ‘tidyverse’ package.

While it is not customary to keep R Notebook outputs under version
control, in this case, the files: `001-read-and-format.nb.html` and
`002-plot-data.nb.html` are included in the repository.

This is because there typeset versions are included in a GitHub Pages
web page, so that they may be viewed correctly on the web, if desired.
Links to those are here:
